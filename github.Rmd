# Github

code to send through the shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:Greg1717/coursera_01_git.git
git push -u origin master

... as a result I got following error message... 

Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '140.82.121.4' to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

## Missing SSH key

"Help, I keep getting a 'Permission Denied (publickey)' error when I push!"

This means, on your local machine, you haven't made any SSH keys. Not to worry. Here's how to fix:

- Open git bash (Use the Windows search. To find it, type "git bash") or the **Mac Terminal**. Pro Tip: You can use any *nix based command prompt (but not the default Windows Command Prompt!)
- Type **cd ~/.ssh**. This will take you to the root directory for Git (Likely C:\Users\[YOUR-USER-NAME]\.ssh\ on Windows)
- Within the .ssh folder, there should be these two files: **id_rsa** and **id_rsa**.pub. These are the files that tell your computer how to communicate with GitHub, BitBucket, or any other Git based service. Type **ls** to see a directory listing. If those two files don't show up, proceed to the next step. NOTE: Your SSH keys must be named **id_rsa** and **id_rsa.pub** in order for Git, GitHub, and BitBucket to recognize them by default.
- To create the SSH keys, type **ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "gergely_horvath@icloud.com"**. This will create both **id_rsa** and **id_rsa.pub** files.

***
The last point above created following output in the terminal:

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/Ellyptic/.ssh/id_rsa): id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:5RqMwx/wE8lQsfXKOIGdbSxkc7eXes1RZeq2N5KI/pI gergely_horvath@icloud.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|      ..*.o .   =|
|       B X o . +.|
|      o X = o +. |
|     . = X . + o.|
|      + S + . + o|
|       o *. .o.. |
|        o... o...|
|        .E    ...|
|         .o.     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
***

- Now, go and **open id_rsa.pub** in your favorite text editor (you can do this via Windows Explorer or the OSX Finder if you like, typing open . will open the folder).
- Copy the contents--exactly as it appears, with no extra spaces or lines--of id_rsa.pub and paste it into GitHub and/or BitBucket under the Account Settings > SSH Keys. NOTE: I like to give the SSH key a descriptive name, usually with the name of the workstation I'm on along with the date.
- Now that you've added your public key to Github and/or BitBucket, try to git push again and see if it works. It should!
